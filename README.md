# CS3281&2 (NUS-FBOA aka Thematic Systems Project)

## Learning outcomes 

There are two main Intended Learning Outcomes, to be achieved at *basic*, *intermediate*, and 
*advanced* levels. 

### ILO1. Able to work in big production systems (80%) 

#### Strategies

You must contribute to two non-trivial OSS projects: one must be an *internal* project and one must 
be an *external* project. 

* Internal projects: HubTurbo (HT), PowerPointLabs (PL), TEAMMATES (TM), Coursemology (CM) 

* External projects: Socket.IO (SI), Code Bender (CB), Any well-known, big, mature OSS project (e.g. 
projects that take part in GSoC). 

You must do a *major contribution* to one of the projects and one *minor contribution* to the other 
project 

* Major contribution: 

  * Comprises 70% of the final grade. 

  * The project for the major contribution is pre-allocated based on your preferences (submitted 
    previously via the IVLE survey), your qualifications, and requirements of each project. You will
    be informed of the project allocation a few days before the semester starts. 

  * Mutual swapping of the major project is allowed as long as it is done by the first day of the 
    semester. To swap projects: contact classmates allocated to your target project and ask if any
    of them is willing to swap projects with you. If someone agrees to swap, email us at 
    [cs3281-staff@googlegroups.com](mailto:cs3281-staff@googlegroups.com) and copy the other party.
    Do NOT request a project change from us until you have found someone willing to swap. 

  * To be done in teams of 3-5. Your team is defined by your major project. The teams we have this 
    semester are: Team-CB, Team-HT, Team-PL, Team-SI, Team-TM. 

* Minor contribution: 

  * Counts for 10% of the final grade. 

  * You are allowed to choose the project for this component. 

  * Work done outside the module is eligible. 

  * If your minor project is an external project, you are encouraged to persuade other classmates to 
    choose the same project for minor contribution. If multiple students work on the same project,
    you can rely on each other for peer support. 

* At least 4 projects should be covered by members of a team. e.g. a 3-member team can do a major 
contribution to one project and minor contributions to 3 other projects. 

#### Achievement levels

* Basic: 

  * Learn the domain, process, and tool stack of at least two projects 

  * Do a minor contribution to a project with no special guidance from the project 

  * Add a significant feature to an existing code base 

* Intermediate: 

  * Compare processes of two or more projects 

  * Merge a significant feature to the production branch of a project 

* Advanced 

  * Suggest how to improve the process of a project 

  * Mentor new members of a project 


#### Milestones

For major contribution: 

1. Project set up (Team) 

   * Deliverable: build and run tests on own computer 

2. Project understood (Team) 

   * Deliverable: Team explains the project (product, domain, design, etc.) to tutors/peers at a 
meeting + Q&A session. 

3. Workflow learned 

   * Deliverable: Fix a few issues 

4. Feature planned 

   * Includes a delivery plan approved by the project mentors. Early and incremental delivery
     required 

   * Deliverable: post plan in website (see [Communication](#heading=h.8n4noqyjkgbi) section below) 

5. Roles divided 

   * As the project may be too big to learn on your own, divide the burden of learning among team
     members. Try to have at least one member in charge for each relevant aspect e.g. if the feature
     requires changes to the DB layer, at least one team member should be tasked with learning the
     DB part of the project. 

   * Deliverable: post roles in website 

6. Feature merged 

   * Workflow to be discussed with respective project members. Here’s an example workflow that
     allows you to peer review code before submitting code for project mentor’s review: Create a
     github org for team, fork main repo to team org, create a feature branch, fork from team repo
     for each member, PR against team repo feature branch, review each other’s code. When the
     feature is ready, PR team repo feature branch against main repo. 

   * Deliverable: update plan in website periodically 

For minor contribution: 

1. Project selected 

   * Deliverable: state choice in the module website 

2. Project set up 

   * Deliverable: show set up to tutor 

3. First PR submitted 

   * Deliverable: post link to PR in the module website 

4. 2 PRs merged 

   * Bug fixes or minor enhancements 

   * Deliverable: post link to PRs in the module website 

5. Processes of projects compared 

   * Deliverable: create blog post and give link in the module website 

6. Areas for process improvements identified, improvements suggested 

   * Deliverable: create blog post and give link in the module website 

### ILO2. Able to develop an expertise (20%) 

#### Strategies

* You must pick a tool/technology, and develop an expertise in it (let’s call it X) 

* To be done individually. 

* Work done outside the module is eligible. 

#### Achievements

* Basic:

  * Explain at breadth (i.e. where does X fit into the big picture?), explain at depth (i.e. what
    are some of the advanced things related to X?) 

* Intermediate: 

  * Compare and contrast X with other related products. 

* Advanced: 

  * Establish credentials by teaching, troubleshooting, evangelizing, etc. 

#### Milestones

* Technology selected 

  * Deliverable: update module website 

* High-level view understood 

  * Deliverable: blog post about X, face Q&A session 

* In-depth knowledge gained 

  * Deliverable: blog post about an in-depth topic, face Q&A session 

* Online evidence established 

  * Deliverable: post links to online credentials, face Q&A session 

## Communication 

* For class matters: use IVLE forum 

* For interacting with the project mentors: use channels specified by the project 

* For communication among team: up to you 

* To contact teaching team: email to cs3281-staff@googlegroups.com 

* Progress reporting: done via the Project progress page of this module website. When you need to 
update any information about your team or yourself, submit a PR.
